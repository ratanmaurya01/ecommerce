In my code I used both admin and consumer in single page.

•	Frontend (Rect.js): Create a simple frontend to view products, add them to the cart, and place an order.
•	Backend (Node.js): Use Node.js with Express or Nest.js and integrate it with a PostgreSQL database.
•	Payment Gateway: Integrate any payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal).
•	Admin Portal: Create an admin portal to view orders and products, with real-time updates.
